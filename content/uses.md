The idea of a Uses page is to tell you about the stuff I use.

Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for a list of everyone's Uses pages!

If I get asked about what software or hardware I use this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious readers to.

## OS Platform and browser

I'm a polygot, and try not to focus on a single platform.  These are ordered in what I use most to least.

- MacOS + Kali Linux VM
- ChromeOS /w Debian Linux dev environment
- Windows Desktop

And on all of them I use the same browser
